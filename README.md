### Abstract:
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Approximately 85% of cases are the result of a spontaneous development of abnormal prion proteins in the brain. Between 5-15% of cases have a hereditary component that causes inheritance of prion protein mutations leading to CJD. Data provided consists of whole-exome sequence data and familial relations of 23 members of an Israeli kindred having a E200K mutation in the PRNP gene, which is consistent with 100% penetrance of the disease. Within this dataset, two “super-resilient” members of this family lived into their 90s, many standard deviations beyond the typical onset and death from the disease, which is 50 years old and 55 years old respectively. The purpose of this database is to determine variants associated with disease protection that are observed in these “super-resilient” cases.
